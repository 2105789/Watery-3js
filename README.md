# ThreeJS Caustics

Welcome to the ThreeJS Caustics project! This project showcases a stunning water simulation with realistic caustics and environmental reflections. It demonstrates the power of Three.js, a popular JavaScript 3D library, in creating visually captivating and interactive scenes.

## Features

- Realistic water simulation with dynamic waves and ripples
- Accurate caustics rendering, simulating the patterns created by light refracting through water
- Environmental reflections on the water surface, creating a seamless integration with the surroundings
- Interactive sphere movement controlled by keyboard input (W, A, S, D)
- Collectible cubes that increase the score when collected by the sphere
- Obstacle mines that end the game if the sphere collides with them
- Skybox with a tropical sunny day environment
- Floating rocks and a foam effect on the water surface
- Performance stats display (FPS, CPU, RAM usage)
- Dat.GUI integration for adjusting various parameters in real-time

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ThreeJS-Caustics.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ThreeJS-Caustics`
3. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

## Controls

- **W**: Move the sphere forward
- **A**: Move the sphere left
- **S**: Move the sphere backward
- **D**: Move the sphere right
- **Mouse Movement**: Interacts with the water surface, creating ripples
